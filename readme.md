# weakness-stink 😎

Made this bot for me and my friends. Feels free to use (star and fork as well 😁). Everything is easy to setup.

## Prerequisites

You need to create telegram bot. Take its token and run

```bash
export API_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
```

Then you need to install python packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Initialize db

Just run:

```bash
python init_db.py
```

This will create db.sql file

## Usage

Now you are ready to run your bot. Use this command:

```bash
python main.py
```
